# nixos-config

This repository contains my personal NixOS configuration, managed declaratively with flakes and home-manager. Major work in progress, frequent changes and broken states to be expected.

## Goals:
- Get a solid base config working with flakes + home-manager
- Configure Hyprland as the daily driver WM
- Add custom modules for security, dev tools, and pentesting
- Keep dotfiles tidy and portable
- Slowly build this into a fully automated setup I can rebuild anywhere
